# Getting Started

Your Mac is ready to run RubyMotion, but it is a good idea to view initial screencasts which make understand the concepts in a visual way


## Official intro screencast

(http://www.youtube.com/user/hipbyte)[http://www.youtube.com/user/hipbyte] on this Youtube channel you can find 2 interesting videos and hope there would be more videos published in coming days.

[RubyMotion: Introduction Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_M2wQYRzwQ) 8:51

[RubyMotion: Interactive Console Demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejYKzLglSE) 1:09

Interctive Console/REPL is the killer feature which makes it worth diving into RubyMotion.


## Pragmatic Studios screencast

This is a longer version and shows a full cycle of building a app from scratch, self explanatory.
